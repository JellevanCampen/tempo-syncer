# J.TempoSyncer

Application to convert a collection of music tracks to have desired properties (e.g., "tempo is 180 BPM", "mean volume is -14 LUFS", "files names are format 'artist - title'"... ). 

**Source track collections** contain songs in their original format. Tracks from source track collections can be added to **target track collections** with **target track properties**. The application will modify the audio tracks added to a target track collection to conform with the target track properties.
